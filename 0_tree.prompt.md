- Detect the main technologies used (e.g., Angular, .NET 8, ABP.NET Zero).
- Summarize the purpose of each major folder and file.
- Highlight any architectural layers (e.g., domain, application, infrastructure).
- Point out key entry points, configuration files, and areas for extension or refactoring.
